                <h4>The Situation Testing Algorithm</h4>
                <h5>A Short Story</h5>
                <p>
                    <b>The premise:</b> Suppose that you work for a bank and
                    need to determine if a new client is eligible for a loan for
                    a house. This new client has a set of different
                    characteristics, like age, saving account, employment
                    status, and so on. These characteristics can take values
                    like 29, 31 or 51 for their age. You also have a dataset
                    that contains the same set of characteristics for people
                    that have already applied for a loan for a house. Because
                    this job is very repetitive you have a system that
                    determines if a client is eligible for a loan given their
                    characteristics. But sometimes this system gives weird
                    results, like a female person that has a lot of money on
                    their saving account and a good job, but still gets
                    rejected. It does this for a lot of women. Now you want to
                    know if this system is truly discriminating against people.
                    This is where this tool comes into play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Discrimination detection with this tool:</b> The way this
                    tool detects discrimination is by comparing two groups of
                    people. One group is a protected group, meaning that their
                    sex is like in our example female. The other group is the
                    unprotected group and consists of people that aren't female.
                    We now determine a decision of the acceptance of a loan like
                    'accepted' or 'rejected' if people in the protected group
                    are discriminated against. We will only do this for those
                    who are female and received a negative decision, in other
                    words, the ones who were rejected. Let's say that we try to
                    determine if a woman named Carla is discriminated against
                    because her request for a loan didn't get accepted. We will
                    search 3 of the most similar people in the protected group,
                    and we will name them Carla's protected neighbors, and 3 in
                    the unprotected group, are called Carla's unprotected
                    neighbors. Let's say that we found 1 'rejected' among
                    Carla's unprotected neighbors and 2 negative decisions in
                    the new protected neighbors. This means that Carla has more
                    neighbors in her protected neighborhood than in her
                    unprotected neighborhood. This means that she has a higher
                    chance of being discriminated against because she is female.
                </p>
                <h5>More Technical</h5>
                <p>
                    This tool detects discriminated tuples, the
                    tuple is a structure that contains multiple elements like
                    attributes of people, e.g. (age=31, job=CEO, ...,
                    sex=female). We say we have <i
                        class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected tuples when
                    they adhere to the following condition:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We determine a set of <b>sensitive variables</b>, like
                        sex, race, etcetera. Then we determine the values for
                        which we want to know if that group is discriminated
                        against, e.g. use sex=female to know if females are
                        discriminated against. Therefore, a tuple is protected
                        if they have all the <b>sensitive variable</b> values.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    We also need to determine on what basis we want to check
                    if someone is discriminated against. This is done by
                    defining the <b>decision variable</b> like the class. We
                    also need to determine the <b>decision value</b> which
                    can be a value like 'accepted' or 'rejected'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we have defined the values of these variables, we
                    divide them into two groups, the <i
                        class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected and <i
                        class="fas fa-user"></i> unprotected tuples. We will go
                    over every <i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected
                    tuple with the decision value. Then, we determine its
                    nearest neighbors or most similar tuples. We have <b>k</b>,
                    a number (1, 2, 3, ...), neighbors for
                    each of the <i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected and
                    <i
                            class="fas fa-user"></i> unprotected tuples. Once we
                    determined these neighbors we will take the difference in
                    the number of decision values of both groups divided by
                    <b>k</b> ((# in prot group - # in unprot group) / k), e.g.
                    if we have 1 <i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> neighboring
                    protected tuple with a decision value of 'rejected' and 0 <i
                        class="fas fa-user"></i> unprotected tuples which are
                    'rejected', then the difference is 1/2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A positive number for a negative decision value, means that
                    there may be discrimination, while for a positive decision
                    value this must be a negative number.

                <h4>The Default Dataset - German Credit Dataset</h4>
                <p>
                    The German credit dataset is a dataset that contains a lot
                    of tuples. It is typically used to determine whether one
                    receives a loan based on its tuple values. The variables
                    are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age (interval): The age of the person</li>
                    <li>Sex (nominal): The sex of the person</li>
                    <li>Job (ordinal): The type of job they have</li>
                    <li>Housing (nominal): How they are housed, i.e. rent, own,
                        ...
                    </li>
                    <li>Saving accounts (ordinal): What amount the person has on
                        its saving accounts
                    </li>
                    <li>Checking account (ordinal): What amount the person has
                        on its checking account
                    </li>
                    <li>Credit amount (interval): The persons credit score</li>
                    <li>Duration (interval): The duration over which the person
                        wants to return the loan
                    </li>
                    <li>Purpose (nominal): What the loan is for</li>
                    <li>Class (interval): Whether the loan has been accepted or
                        not
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The values between parentheses are the types of the values.
                    The nominal values are categorical values, like baker,
                    developer, consultant, ..., the ordinal values are
                    categorical values that can be ordered, like good, better,
                    and best, and the interval values are numerical values, e.g.
                    1, 5, 3, etc.
