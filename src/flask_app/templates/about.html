                <h3>About the Discrimination Tool</h3>
                <h4>The Situation Testing Algorithm</h4>
                <h5>A Short Story</h5>
                <p>
                    <b>The premise:</b> Suppose that you work for a bank and
                    need to determine if a new client is eligible for a loan for
                    a house. You have a dataset of previous clients and their
                    characteristics, like age, saving account, credit amount,
                    etc.. This new client has the same set of characteristics.
                    You have a system in place that determines if a
                    client is eligible for a loan based on those
                    characteristics. You want to know if this system is
                    discriminating against certain groups of people, like people
                    of color. This tool can determine if there is discrimination
                    at play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Discrimination detection:</b> The way you achieve this is
                    by dividing people into two groups. One group is a protected
                    group meaning that their characteristics can be female. The
                    other group is the unprotected group and are the people that
                    aren't female. We now determine for a decision like
                    'accepted' or 'rejected' if people in the protected group
                    are discriminated against. We only do this for those who are
                    female and received a negative decision ('rejected'). We now
                    find for each person in that group the most similar people
                    in both the protected and unprotected group, both groups
                    have the same size, for this example 2. Let's say that we've
                    found 0 'rejected' in the unprotected group and 1 negative
                    decision in the protected group. This means that the person
                    that is currently checked possibly is discriminated as we
                    have less negative decisions in the small unprotected group.
                </p>
                <h5>More Technical</h5>
                <p>
                    This tool detects discriminated tuples, the
                    tuple is a structure that contains multiple elements like
                    attributes of people, e.g. (age=31, job=CEO, ...,
                    sex=female). We say we have <i
                        class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected tuples when
                    they adhere to the following condition:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We determine a set of <b>sensitive variables</b>, like
                        sex, race, etcetera. Then we determine the values for
                        which we want to know if that group is discriminated
                        against, e.g. use sex=female to know if females are
                        discriminated against. Therefore, a tuple is protected
                        if they have all the <b>sensitive variable</b> values.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    We also need to determine on what basis we want to check
                    if someone is discriminated against. This is done by
                    defining the <b>decision variable</b> like the class. We
                    also need to determine the <b>decision value</b> which
                    can be a value like 'accepted' or 'rejected'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we have defined the values of these variables, we
                    divide them into two groups, the <i
                        class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected and <i
                        class="fas fa-user"></i> unprotected tuples. We will go
                    over every <i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected
                    tuple with the decision value. Then, we determine its
                    nearest neighbors or most similar tuples. We have <b>k</b>,
                    a number (1, 2, 3, ...), neighbors for
                    each the <i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> protected and <i
                        class="fas fa-user"></i> unprotected tuples. Once we
                    determined these neighbors we will take the difference in
                    the number of decision values of both groups divided by
                    <b>k</b> ((# in prot group - # in unprot group) / k), e.g.
                    if we have 1 <i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i> neighboring
                    protected tuple with a decision value of 'rejected' and 0 <i
                        class="fas fa-user"></i> unprotected tuples which are
                    'rejected', then the difference is 1/2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A positive number for a negative decision value means that
                    there may be discrimination, while for a positive decision
                    value this must be a negative number.

                <h4>The Default Dataset - German Credit Dataset</h4>
                <p>
                    The German credit dataset is a dataset that contains a lot
                    of tuples. It is typically used to determine whether one
                    receives a loan based on its tuple values. The variables
                    are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age (interval): The age of the person</li>
                    <li>Sex (nominal): The sex of the person</li>
                    <li>Job (ordinal): The type of job they have</li>
                    <li>Housing (nominal): How they are housed, i.e. rent, own,
                        ...
                    </li>
                    <li>Saving accounts (ordinal): What amount the person has on
                        its saving accounts
                    </li>
                    <li>Checking account (ordinal): What amount the person has
                        on its checking account
                    </li>
                    <li>Credit amount (interval): The persons credit score</li>
                    <li>Duration (interval): The duration over which the person
                        wants to return the loan
                    </li>
                    <li>Purpose (nominal): What the loan is for</li>
                    <li>Class (interval): Whether the loan has been accepted or
                        not
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The values between parentheses are the types of the values.
                    The nominal values are categorical values, like baker,
                    developer, consultant, ..., the ordinal values are
                    categorical values that can be ordered, like good, better,
                    best, and the interval values are numerical values, e.g.
                    1, 5, 3, etc..
